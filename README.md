This repo provides a calculation of number of representatives for each state, according to the Hamilton Algorithm and Huntington-Hill's Algorithm. 
The default calculation option is based on Huntington-Hill's method, so by clicking on the submit button the user gets the list of states in alphabetical order, as well as the number of representatives that would be assigned to each state based on Huntington's method.
In case the user doesn't specify the number of representatives, the default is set to 435.
