This repo provides a calculation of number of representatives for each state, according to the Hamilton Algorithm and Huntington-Hill's algorithm.
The default calculation is based on Huntington-Hill's, so by clicking the submit button you get the list of states in alphabetical order plus the number of representatives that would be assigned to each state. 
In case user doesn't specify the number of representatives, the default is set to 435 representatives.
